    "- This function first creates a copy of the input DataFrame and then converts the `quantity` and `ucost` columns to `float` to handle `NaN` values. It then creates two conditions: one for `quantity` and one for `ucost`, checking if either column contains the values `[99, 98, 999]`. The code then replaces `quantity` and `ucost` with `NaN` wherever these conditions are met."
