# The Data
* For this project, we use our popular [Online Retail Store Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyangweso-rodgers/Data_Analytics/main/Datasets/Online_Retail.csv)

# Aggregate
* __agg__ is one of the most flexible functions, providing the user with various ways of applying multiple functions to the same feature, or multiple functions to multiple features. 
* __Aggregate__ can be used with or without a __groupby__ statement and can be applied across either rows or column axes.
